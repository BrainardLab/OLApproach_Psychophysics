    * Add OL to the names of routines copied over from +Psychophysics.
        Need to change call, and header comments to match.
        I deleted the +Psychophysics versions already.

General

    
    * I think that files that get written into MELA_data do not use cache files. These
    get run per session and we have a scheme that keeps them apart.  This would apply
    to the corrected primaries and validations, for example, as well as the Modulations.

    * We should review the prefs we set up in OLApproach_Psyhchophysics.  I think we may
    not need all of them.

    * MakeModulationStartsStops - This routine has modulations hard coded in it, but these
    should be passed in from the calling protocol file.  And it should be called
    OLMakeModulationStartsStops.

    * OLReceptorIsolateMakeModulationStartsStops - This is in desparate need of documentation
    and cleaning.

    * Dictionaries.  Each "thing" should have a type as its first field, and the defaults and checking
    should be by type.
      - Let's add comments to each default routine that says what each field is about.

    * Routines that cache backgrounds and directions should do a parameter field check on read, and
      call the cache stale if parameters have changed.

    * SilentSubstitutionToolbox.  The routine GetHumanPhotoreceptorSS was updated
    in a way that is not backwards compatible with 'Hemo' types, and this breaks
    the routine OLEstimateConePhotopigmentFractionRoutine.  The latter routine is
    in the OneLightToolbox, but should probably renamed and moved into the SilentSubstitutionToolbox.
      - The header comments of GetHumanPhotoreceptorSS are stale.

    * SilentSubstitutionToolbox.  Routine ReceptorIsolateOptimBackgroundMulti needs its
    comments updated to match what it does.
      - It is possible that we should make RecetporIsolate call through this, as in some
        sense it is a generalization.  But write some good unit tests first.

    * Need to get light flux modulations working in new code.

    * There is old splatter code that we pulled out.  Probably want a way to run splatter analyses
    easily, based on direction/validation files.  This should be modular.

    * Spectral correction.  There are lot of parameters for the spectrum seeking.  Should set
      these in a box specific dictionary, so we can customize seeking for each box. 
      - Might want to handle calibrations across boxes in this way too, having dictionary 
        entries that describe the calibration parameters for each box.
