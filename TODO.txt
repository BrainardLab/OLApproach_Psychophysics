* Add OL to the names of routines copied over from +Psychophysics.
    Need to change call, and header comments to match.
    I deleted the +Psychophysics versions already.

* I think that files that get written into MELA_data do not use cache files. These
get run per session and we have a scheme that keeps them apart.  This would apply
to the corrected primaries and validations, for example, as well as the Modulations.

* Take off subject/date/session from files stored in subject/date/session directory trees.
    - For example, corrected direction primaries, modulations, etc.

* We should review the prefs we set up in OLApproach_Psyhchophysics.  I think we may
not need all of them.

* MakeModulationStartsStops - This routine has modulations hard coded in it, but these
should be passed in from the calling protocol file.  And it should be called
OLMakeModulationStartsStops.

* OLReceptorIsolateMakeModulationStartsStops - This is in desparate need of documentation
and cleaning.

* Dictionaries.  Each "thing" should have a type as its first field, and the defaults and checking
should be by type.
  - Let's add comments to each default routine that says what each field is about.

* Routines that cache backgrounds and directions should do a parameter field check on read, and
  call the cache stale if parameters have changed.

* SilentSubstitutionToolbox.  The routine GetHumanPhotoreceptorSS was updated
in a way that is not backwards compatible with 'Hemo' types, and this breaks
the routine OLEstimateConePhotopigmentFraction routine.  The latter routine is
in the OneLightToolbox, but should probably renamed and moved into the SilentSubstitutionToolbox.
  - The header comments of GetHumanPhotoreceptorSS are stale.
  - The "Hemo" code in OLEstimateConePhotopigmentFraction is currently commented out.
    Lines 58, 80-81, 88.

* SilentSubstitutionToolbox.  Routine ReceptorIsolateOptimBackgroundMulti needs its
comments updated to match what it does.
  - It is possible that we should make RecetporIsolate call through this, as in some
    sense it is a generalization.  But write some good unit tests first.
  - Deep question, in ReceptorIsolate should we be smoothing primaries or spectra?  We
    currently do the latter.

* Need to get light flux modulations working in new code.

* There is old splatter code that we pulled out.  Probably want a way to run splatter analyses
easily, based on direction/validation files.  This should be modular.

* Spectral correction.  There are lot of parameters for the spectrum seeking.  Should set
  these in a box specific dictionary, so we can customize seeking for each box. 
  - Might want to handle calibrations across boxes in this way too, having dictionary 
    entries that describe the calibration parameters for each box.

* Organize saving and analysis of state measurements.  We make these when we calibrate, as
  we warm up the device, when we spectrum seek, and when we validate.  We should make it 
  easy to understand what we get and what we measure.
  - Also, OLAnalyzeCalOOC currently is very slow and prints out many many plots.  Most of these
    should be turned off by default.  They are useful when we are deeply trying to understand
    how the boxes work, but way too much to stare at every time.

* The direction cache files store backgrounds, differences, and +/- modulations.  This is redundant
  and can lead to inconsistencies.  Clean up someday.
